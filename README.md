# Chattercat frontend

## Description

Chattercat is a chatroom website which allows you to create rooms, password-protect them, invite others players via a unique URL, eject players as the room boss, transfer role of room boss, and award stars to players. It handles this effectively using Socket.IO, managing multiple player interactions responsively.

It is intended as a jumping-off-point for creating online games. Players can create and join rooms, and award stars, which can be adapted into a points system for the game in question.

## Deploy

General instructions for taking a **React project** and hosting it on **Netlify** for **automatic deployment** are as follows:

0. Ensure the project is initialised in a Git repository. If you are unsure what this means, instructions can be found [here](https://medium.com/@JinnaBalu/initialize-local-git-repository-push-to-the-remote-repository-787f83ff999) and [here](https://www.theserverside.com/video/How-to-create-a-local-repository-with-the-git-init-command).

1. Login to Netlify and click _New Site from Git_, then select _Github_ and then the project in question. Set the command as `npm run build`.

Now when you commit and push to Github, Netlify will deploy the latest version of the project automatically.
